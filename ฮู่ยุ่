     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable&lt;br&gt;      copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&lt;br&gt;      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the&lt;br&gt;      work and such derivative works in source or object form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   3. grant of patent license. subject to the terms and conditions of&lt;br&gt;      this license, each contributor hereby grants to you a perpetual,&lt;br&gt;      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable&lt;br&gt;      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,&lt;br&gt;      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the work,&lt;br&gt;      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable&lt;br&gt;      by such contributor that are necessarily infringed by their&lt;br&gt;      contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s)&lt;br&gt;      with the work to which such contribution(s) was submitted. if you&lt;br&gt;      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&lt;br&gt;      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the work&lt;br&gt;      or a contribution incorporated within the work constitutes direct&lt;br&gt;      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&lt;br&gt;      granted to you under this license for that work shall terminate&lt;br&gt;      as of the date such litigation is filed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   4. redistribution. you may reproduce and distribute copies of the&lt;br&gt;      work or derivative works thereof in any medium, with or without&lt;br&gt;      modifications, and in source or object form, provided that you&lt;br&gt;      meet the following conditions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      (a) you must give any other recipients of the work or&lt;br&gt;          derivative works a copy of this license; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      (b) you must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&lt;br&gt;          stating that you changed the files; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      (c) you must retain, in the source form of any derivative works&lt;br&gt;          that you distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&lt;br&gt;          attribution notices from the source form of the work,&lt;br&gt;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&lt;br&gt;          the derivative works; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      (d) if the work includes a "notice" text file as part of its&lt;br&gt;          distribution, then any derivative works that you distribute must&lt;br&gt;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&lt;br&gt;          within such notice file, excluding those notices that do not&lt;br&gt;          pertain to any part of the derivative works, in at least one&lt;br&gt;          of the following places: within a notice text file distributed&lt;br&gt;          as part of the derivative works; within the source form or&lt;br&gt;          documentation, if provided along with the derivative works; or,&lt;br&gt;          within a display generated by the derivative works, if and&lt;br&gt;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. the contents&lt;br&gt;          of the notice file are for informational purposes only and&lt;br&gt;          do not modify the license. you may add your own attribution&lt;br&gt;          notices within derivative works that you distribute, alongside&lt;br&gt;          or as an addendum to the notice text from the work, provided&lt;br&gt;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&lt;br&gt;          as modifying the license.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      you may add your own copyright statement to your modifications and&lt;br&gt;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&lt;br&gt;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of your modifications, or&lt;br&gt;      for any such derivative works as a whole, provided your use,&lt;br&gt;      reproduction, and distribution of the work otherwise complies with&lt;br&gt;      the conditions stated in this license.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   5. submission of contributions. unless you explicitly state otherwise,&lt;br&gt;      any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work&lt;br&gt;      by you to the licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&lt;br&gt;      this license, without any additional terms or conditions.&lt;br&gt;      notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&lt;br&gt;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&lt;br&gt;      with licensor regarding such contributions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   6. trademarks. this license does not grant permission to use the trade&lt;br&gt;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the licensor,&lt;br&gt;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&lt;br&gt;      origin of the work and reproducing the content of the notice file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   7. disclaimer of warranty. unless required by applicable law or&lt;br&gt;      agreed to in writing, licensor provides the work (and each&lt;br&gt;      contributor provides its contributions) on an "as is" basis,&lt;br&gt;      without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or&lt;br&gt;      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&lt;br&gt;      of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a&lt;br&gt;      particular purpose. you are solely responsible for determining the&lt;br&gt;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the work and assume any&lt;br&gt;      risks associated with your exercise of permissions under this license.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   8. limitation of liability. in no event and under no legal theory,&lt;br&gt;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&lt;br&gt;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&lt;br&gt;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any contributor be&lt;br&gt;      liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&lt;br&gt;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&lt;br&gt;      result of this license or out of the use or inability to use the&lt;br&gt;      work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&lt;br&gt;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&lt;br&gt;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such contributor&lt;br&gt;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   9. accepting warranty or additional liability. while redistributing&lt;br&gt;      the work or derivative works thereof, you may choose to offer,&lt;br&gt;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&lt;br&gt;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&lt;br&gt;      license. however, in accepting such obligations, you may act only&lt;br&gt;      on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf&lt;br&gt;      of any other contributor, and only if you agree to indemnify,&lt;br&gt;      defend, and hold each contributor harmless for any liability&lt;br&gt;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such contributor by reason&lt;br&gt;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   end of terms and conditions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

     liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&lt;br&gt;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&lt;br&gt;      result of this license or out of the use or inability to use the&lt;br&gt;

     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such contributor by reason&lt;br&gt;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   end of terms and conditions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

     with the work to which such contribution(s) was submitted. if you&lt;br&gt;      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&lt;br&gt;      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the work&lt;br&gt;      or a contribution incorporated within the work constitutes direct&lt;br&gt;      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&lt;br&gt;      granted to you under this license for that work shall terminate&lt;br&gt;

         derivative works a copy of this license; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      (b) you must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&lt;br&gt;          stating that you changed the files; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      (c) you must retain, in the source form of any derivative works&lt;br&gt;          that you distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&lt;br&gt;          attribution notices from the source form of the work,&lt;br&gt;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&lt;br&gt;          the derivative works; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      (d) if the work includes a "notice" text file as part of its&lt;br&gt;          distribution, then any derivative works that you distribute must&lt;br&gt;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&lt;br&gt;          within such notice file, excluding those notices that do not&lt;br&gt;          pertain to any part of the derivative works, in at least one&lt;br&gt;          of the following places: within a notice text file distributed&lt;br&gt;          as part of the derivative works; within the source form or&lt;br&gt;          documentation, if provided along with the derivative works; or,&lt;br&gt;          within a display generated by the derivative works, if and&lt;br&gt;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. the contents&lt;br&gt;          of the notice file are for informational purposes only and&lt;br&gt;          do not modify the license. you may add your own attribution&lt;br&gt;          notices within derivative works that you distribute, alongside&lt;br&gt;          or as an addendum to the notice text from the work, provided&lt;br&gt;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&lt;br&gt;          as modifying the license.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      you may add your own copyright statement to your modifications and&lt;br&gt;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&lt;br&gt;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of your modifications, or&lt;br&gt;      for any such derivative works as a whole, provided your use,&lt;br&gt;      reproduction, and distribution of the work otherwise complies with&lt;br&gt;      the conditions stated in this license.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   5. submission of contributions. unless you explicitly state otherwise,&lt;br&gt;      any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work&lt;br&gt;      by you to the licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&lt;br&gt;      this license, without any additional terms or conditions.&lt;br&gt;      notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&lt;br&gt;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&lt;br&gt;      with licensor regarding such contributions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   6. trademarks. this license does not grant permission to use the trade&lt;br&gt;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the licensor,&lt;br&gt;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&lt;br&gt;      origin of the work and reproducing the content of the notice file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   7. disclaimer of warranty. unless required by applicable law or&lt;br&gt;      agreed to in writing, licensor provides the work (and each&lt;br&gt;      contributor provides its contributions) on an "as is" basis,&lt;br&gt;      without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or&lt;br&gt;      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&lt;br&gt;      of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a&lt;br&gt;      particular purpose. you are solely responsible for determining the&lt;br&gt;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the work and assume any&lt;br&gt;      risks associated with your exercise of permissions under this license.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   8. limitation of liability. in no event and under no legal theory,&lt;br&gt;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&lt;br&gt;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&lt;br&gt;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any contributor be&lt;br&gt;      liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&lt;br&gt;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&lt;br&gt;      result of this license or out of the use or inability to use the&lt;br&gt;      work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&lt;br&gt;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&lt;br&gt;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such contributor&lt;br&gt;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   9. accepting warranty or additional liability. while redistributing&lt;br&gt;      the work or derivative works thereof, you may choose to offer,&lt;br&gt;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&lt;br&gt;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&lt;br&gt;      license. however, in accepting such obligations, you may act only&lt;br&gt;      on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf&lt;br&gt;      of any other contributor, and only if you agree to indemnify,&lt;br&gt;      defend, and hold each contributor harmless for any liability&lt;br&gt;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such contributor by reason&lt;br&gt;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   end of terms and conditions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
